## problem
Neither `setInterval()` nor `setTimeout()` are intended to be precise.
The delay you specify as the second argument is only an indication 
of when the code is added in the browser's UI thread queue for possible execution.
If there are other jobs in the queue ahead of it, then that code waits to be executed.
In short: the millisecond delay is not an indication of when the code will be executed,
only an indication of when the job will be queued. If the UI thread is busy,
perhaps dealing wit huser actions, then that code will not execute immediately.

## requestAnimationFrame
```javascript
var lastTime = 0
if(!window.requestAnimationFrame) {
  window.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback, element) {
    var currtime = new Date().getTime()
    var timeToCall = Math.max(0, 16 - (currtime - lastTime))
    var id = window.setTimeout(function() {
      callback(currtime + timeToCall)
    }, timeToCall);
    lastTime = currtime + timeToCall
    return id
  }
}

if(!window.cancelAnimationFrame) {
  window.cancelAnimationFrame = function(id) {
    clearTimeout(id)
  }
}
```
