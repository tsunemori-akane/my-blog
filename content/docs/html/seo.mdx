## Google如何处理网页

1. **Crawling** - [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers)
sends GET requests to a server for the URLs in the crawl queue and saves the response contents. Googlebot does this for HTML, JS, CSS, image files, and more.
2. **Processing** - This includes adding URLs to the crawl queue found within `<a href>` links within the HTML. It also includes queuing resource URLs (CSS/JS) found within `<link>` tags or images within `<img src>` tags. 
If Googlebot finds a noindex tag at this stage, the process stops, Googlebot won't render the content, and Caffeine (Google's indexer) won't index it.
3. **Rendering** - Googlebot executes JavaScript code with a [headless Chromium browser](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) to find additional content within the DOM, but not the HTML source. It does this for all HTML URLs.
4. **Indexing** - Caffeine takes the information from Googlebot, normalizes it (fixes broken HTML), and then tries to make sense of it all, precomputing some ranking signals ready for serving within a search result.
