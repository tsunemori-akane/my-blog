## Google如何处理网页
> source : [ahrefs.com](https://ahrefs.com/blog/react-seo)
1. **Crawling** - [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers)
sends GET requests to a server for the URLs in the crawl queue and saves the response contents. Googlebot does this for HTML, JS, CSS, image files, and more.
2. **Processing** - This includes adding URLs to the crawl queue found within `<a href>` links within the HTML. It also includes queuing resource URLs (CSS/JS) found within `<link>` tags or images within `<img src>` tags. 
If Googlebot finds a noindex tag at this stage, the process stops, Googlebot won't render the content, and Caffeine (Google's indexer) won't index it.
3. **Rendering** - Googlebot executes JavaScript code with a [headless Chromium browser](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) to find additional content within the DOM, but not the HTML source. It does this for all HTML URLs.
4. **Indexing** - Caffeine takes the information from Googlebot, normalizes it (fixes broken HTML), and then tries to make sense of it all, precomputing some ranking signals ready for serving within a search result.

## 单页面应用SPA中的SEO
As the name implies, a SPA literally consists of a single HTML page sent down from the server.
This page is just a shell, SPA framework like Vue focus on updating the body tag.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Vue</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
